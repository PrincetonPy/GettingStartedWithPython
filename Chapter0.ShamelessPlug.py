# We're a growing community, and we have a website ! Check us out at

# <headingcell level=1>

# **`princetonpy.com`**

# <markdowncell>

# We have a discussion forum on which you're welcome to discuss Python-related stuffs and ask questions. It's a great place to do so, because everyone can then see the discussion, rather than having it by email.

# <markdowncell>

# Also : quick thanks to our sponsers : the **Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology**, the **Department of Geosciences**, and **Bryan Grenfell (EEB)** for some extra funding. We really appreciate it !
