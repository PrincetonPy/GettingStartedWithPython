Getting Started With Python
===========================

A very quick set of IPython Notebooks to get you started with Python.


Target Audience
---------------

I'll be using this set of notebooks to give a very brief intro do Python, and how to get started writing in Python. This is not intended to be a standalone tutorial : it's written so you can come back to it and remind yourself of what was said during the session. I hope they'll help.

These notebooks can be viewed at :
